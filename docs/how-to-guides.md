# How to change the file path of Spacewalk's output dataset

This guide shows you how to set the file path for Spacewalk's output
data set to a location of your choice.

By default, the cleaned data set in CSV format, generated by the Spacewalk software, is saved to the `results/`
folder within the working directory with file name `eva-data.csv`.

If you would like to modify the name or location of the output dataset, set the
second command line argument to your chosen file path.
For example, if you want to save the output data set to the subfolder `data/clean/` you can
invoke the script as:

`(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 eva_data_analysis.py eva-data.json data/clean/eva-data-clean.csv`

The specified destination folder `data/clean/` must exist before running spacewalks analysis script.
